# Uber/ Lyft fare predicting in Boston

Unlike traditional public transportation, the pricing of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft is highly dynamic and influenced by various contextual factors. These services employ surge pricing algorithms that adjust fares in real-time based on fluctuations in demand and supply. For instance, ride prices typically increase during peak commuting hours—around 9 AM and 5 PM—when more people are heading to or returning from work. Weather conditions also play a critical role; rainy or snowy days often drive up demand, leading to higher fares.

This project aims to analyze several factor that influence the price of each ride offered by Uber and Lyft. Besides that i will use machine learning model, such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest to predict fare of Uber and Lyft.
